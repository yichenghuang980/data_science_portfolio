      <description>Background In human society, words carry meaning through symbols. However, despite that symbols are easy for humans to understand, such comprehension has been proven difficult for computational systems. To address this problem, researchers introduced word embedding methods. Word embedding, also known as distributed word representation, represents any given word in vector form. The resulting vector of numbers, known as a word vector, is associated with the meaning of that given word in a mathematical form.</description>

      <description>Background Over the past two decades, the United States has seen a tremendous increase in the use and abuse of prescription opioids, leading not only to a huge rise in opioid addiction, but also a rise in prescription overdose deaths, and increasingly deaths from non-prescription opioids like heroin and fentanyl as people who became addicted to opioids due to prescriptions turn to illegal markets to sustain their addiction.
In order to deal with those situations, several states that had notoriety for having high opioids prescriptions and overdose mortality issued their own policies in different years.</description>

      <description>Background With the rapid pace of social development, we humans have enjoyed an easier way of living and commuting. Meanwhile, we are exposed to a growing number of health-threatening substances and sites, which makes it harder for the medicare industry to evaluate health and its cost. Fortunately, the introduction of Humana’s integrated value-based health ecosystem based on Social Determinants of Health brings a promising prospect to this industry.
Among all those challenges to health, transportation challenge stands out to be the most common one since it involves daily life of a person’s commuting, schooling, and living.</description>
